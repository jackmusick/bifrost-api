#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Bifrost test runner — verb-style subcommand interface.
#
# Stack lifecycle (long-lived, per worktree):
#   ./test.sh stack up                  Boot the stack.
#   ./test.sh stack down                Tear it down + remove volumes.
#   ./test.sh stack reset               Fast state reset (DB clone, redis flush, object storage wipe).
#   ./test.sh stack status              Print project name and running services.
#
# Backend tests (stack must be up):
#   ./test.sh                           Unit tests only (fast default).
#   ./test.sh unit                      Same as above.
#   ./test.sh e2e                       Backend e2e tests.
#   ./test.sh all                       All backend tests, including slow tests.
#   ./test.sh tests/path/... [args]     Pass through to pytest.
#
# Quality checks:
#   ./test.sh quality api               Run API pyright + ruff inside Docker.
#
# Client tests:
#   ./test.sh client unit               Vitest on the host (no stack).
#   ./test.sh client e2e                Playwright in the stack's client container.
#   ./test.sh client smoke              Critical zero-retry Playwright merge gate.
#   ./test.sh client nightly            Full product Playwright (docs capture excluded).
#   ./test.sh client e2e --screenshots  Capture a screenshot for every test (UX review).
#   ./test.sh client e2e e2e/auth.unauth.spec.ts   Pass through to playwright.
#
# CI escape hatch:
#   ./test.sh pre-pr                    Required local PR/merge gate for a clean commit.
#   ./test.sh ci                        Full isolated run: up, all tests, down.
#
# Global flags (apply to most subcommands):
#   --no-reset    Skip state reset before running tests.
#   --coverage    Enable coverage reporting (backend only).
#   --wait        On failure, pause before cleanup.
