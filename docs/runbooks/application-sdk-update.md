# Application SDK updates

Bifrost exposes SDK provenance on deployed V2 Apps and lets an administrator
rebuild selected Apps against the SDK shipped by the current Bifrost instance.
This is explicit, not automatic: upgrading Bifrost can make an update visible,
but does not change a deployed App until an administrator starts one.

## Provenance and status

Every successful V2 build records four values on the App:

- `sdk_package_version`: npm-safe Bifrost release version.
- `sdk_fingerprint`: the first 16 hex characters of SHA-256 over the bundled
  SDK bytes. Compatible source changes therefore become visible without a
  manual version bump.
- `sdk_contract_version`: the integer in
  `client/src/lib/app-sdk/sdk-contract.json`. Bump it only for a deliberately
  breaking SDK↔server wire-contract change.
- `sdk_built_at`: when that SDK was activated for the App.

The status contract is `current`, `update_available`, `update_required`,
`unknown`, or `not_applicable`. Missing provenance on an older V2 deployment is
`unknown`; V1 inline Apps are `not_applicable`. App list responses include
whether rebuild source is available. Solution list/get responses provide a
server-computed aggregate and actionable App count, using one bounded App query
rather than fetching every App in the browser.

## Rebuild behavior

`application.sdk_update` is a shared PlatformJob. It resolves the active
deployment's retained source, injects the current SDK tarball, runs the normal
V2 compiler, and atomically swaps the active deployment only after a successful
build. Failure leaves the previous deployment active. The job reports truthful
phases—loading, resolving source, and rebuilding—without synthetic percentages;
completion is 100%.

An SDK-only rebuild of a Solution App extracts only that App from the retained
Solution archive. It must not reconcile the Solution, touch Git or manifests,
or mutate sibling entities. Batch actions enqueue one independently observable
job per actionable App so the scheduler retains its normal admission control,
resource protection, cancellation, and failure reporting.

## Retained source and privacy

Independent V2 deploys retain a sanitized zip beside each immutable deployment.
Solution deploys retain the validated deployed Solution archive. SDK rebuilds
never rely on `node_modules` or an already-built `dist` directory.

Sanitization rejects unsafe archive paths and excludes `.env`, `.env.*`,
`node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `.git`, coverage, framework caches, and
similar generated directories. Independent App source is capped at 256 MiB
expanded. Treat retained source as private deployment material: access follows
the App/Solution authorization boundary and export streams rather than loading
the archive into API memory.

## UI and CLI

Apps keep their normal deployment status and add a separate SDK badge. Starting
an update changes that badge to `Updating SDK`; the menu action becomes disabled
and progress continues through Notifications. Failed jobs show `SDK update
failed` with a retry action. Apps that need an update but lack retained source
also show `Source unavailable`.

CLI operations:

```bash
bifrost apps sdk status [APP]
bifrost apps sdk update APP
bifrost apps sdk update --all
bifrost apps source export APP ./app-source.zip
bifrost solution sdk deployed-status
bifrost solution sdk deployed-update
```

The last two commands operate on Apps belonging to the bound deployed Solution.
`bifrost solution sdk update` remains the local-development command that updates
an App workspace's installed SDK.

## Initial resource benchmark

The spike used the normal scheduler and its 1 GiB job memory limit. A small App
SDK update completed in 9.76 seconds, starting at 270.6 MiB and peaking at
713.8 MiB (443.2 MiB increase). A dependency-heavy App update completed in
15.88 seconds, starting at 196.0 MiB and peaking at 561.4 MiB (365.4 MiB
increase). Its preceding full deploy took 16.44 seconds and increased by
212.4 MiB.

These are development-stack observations, not capacity guarantees. They do
show that the remembered 200 MiB estimate is too low; keep the PlatformJob's
512 MiB minimum memory-headroom policy until production-like measurements
justify changing it.
