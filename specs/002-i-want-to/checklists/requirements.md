# Specification Quality Checklist: Workflow Engine and User Code Separation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Validation Notes**:
- All 3 user stories are properly prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are testable and unambiguous
- 7 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios, size limits, and security boundaries
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for storage limits, repository access, and security approaches
- Single clarification question resolved (FR-012: storage failure handling)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning
