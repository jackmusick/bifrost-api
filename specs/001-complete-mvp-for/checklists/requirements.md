# Specification Quality Checklist: MSP Automation Platform MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec describes WHAT users need (forms, workflows, org management) without HOW to implement
- ✅ Written from user and business perspective (MSP admins, technicians, developers)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria
- ⚠️ Some technical terms present (Table Storage, Azure AD) but necessary for context - acceptable

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ All 25 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST statements
- ✅ 15 success criteria with specific metrics (time, count, percentage)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation (e.g., "create org in under 2 minutes")
- ✅ 8 user stories with 5 acceptance scenarios each (40 total scenarios)
- ✅ 10 edge cases identified covering failure modes and boundary conditions
- ✅ Scope bounded by MVP focus (no advanced features like scheduled workflows, reporting dashboards)
- ✅ 15 assumptions documented covering Azure setup, developer knowledge, and operational constraints

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ 25 functional requirements map to 8 user stories with acceptance scenarios
- ✅ User stories cover: Org mgmt, auth/permissions, workflow dev, data providers, forms, execution, history
- ✅ Success criteria include both user-facing (time to complete tasks) and system-level (performance, security) outcomes
- ✅ Spec remains technology-agnostic in requirements while providing context where necessary

## Notes

- **PASS**: All checklist items validated successfully
- **No blocking issues**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- **Recommendations**:
  - Consider adding user story for "Workflow Testing & Local Development" to explicitly cover developer debugging flow
  - May want to split execution history (P3) into separate feature post-MVP if timeline is tight
  - Data provider naming is good - much better than "options"
- **Next Steps**: Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
