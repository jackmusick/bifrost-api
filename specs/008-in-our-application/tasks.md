# Tasks: Browser-Based Code Editor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-in-our-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test-first development per Constitution Principle IV - tests written before implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Frontend**: `client/src/`
- **Backend**: `api/`
- Tests first, then implementation (TDD per Constitution)
