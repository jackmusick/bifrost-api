# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic Data Provider Inputs for Forms

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Spec is written in user-centric language without mentioning Python, Azure Functions, React, or TypeScript
- Focus is on what users need to accomplish (configure dropdowns, reference fields, prevent errors)
- Non-technical stakeholders can understand the feature scope and value
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear expected behaviors
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 minutes, 500ms, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%)
- Success criteria are written from user perspective without implementation details
- 7 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Scope is bounded by the form builder and runtime contexts
- Assumptions section clearly documents 7 foundational assumptions

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3, P2) cover the complete feature scope
- Each user story is independently testable as specified
- Success criteria align with user stories and requirements
- No mention of specific APIs, database schemas, or code structures

## Notes

This specification is ready for the next phase. It provides:
1. Clear prioritization with P1 (static inputs) as the foundational MVP
2. Well-defined progression from static to dynamic to expression-based inputs
3. Comprehensive edge case handling
4. Measurable success criteria that can be validated
5. No ambiguities requiring clarification

Recommended next steps:
- Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation planning artifacts
- Consider `/speckit.checklist` for creating a custom feature validation checklist
