---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Configure Data Provider with Static Input Values (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable data providers to define input parameters using @param decorators and allow forms to configure static values for those parameters. Forms can be saved and rendered with static data provider inputs.

**Independent Test**: Create a form with a dropdown field configured to use a data provider that requires inputs. Set static values for all required inputs in the form builder JSON. Verify the dropdown populates correctly when the form is rendered and calls the data provider with the static input values.

### Tests for User Story 1

- [ ] T044 [US1] Manual test: Call data provider with static inputs via API
- [ ] T045 [US1] Manual test: Create form with static inputs in form builder UI

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - data providers can define parameters, forms can configure static values, and the system validates and executes correctly.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Reference Other Form Fields as Data Provider Inputs (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable form fields to reference other fields as input values (field reference mode). Dropdowns automatically refresh on blur events when referenced field values change. Fields are disabled with explanatory messages when required inputs are missing.

**Independent Test**: Create a form with two fields - a text input for a token and a dropdown that references that token field as an input parameter. Enter a value in the token field and verify that leaving focus (blur) triggers a refresh of the dropdown with the new token value. Verify the dropdown is disabled before the token is entered.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [ ] T051 [US2] Add validation for forward references (field must appear earlier) in `shared/handlers/forms_handlers.py::validate_field_order()`

#### Frontend: Field Reference Mode & Dynamic Refresh

- [ ] T052 [US2] Extend DataProviderInputConfig component to support field reference mode in `client/src/components/FormBuilder/DataProviderInputConfig.tsx`
- [ ] T053 [US2] Add field reference dropdown showing only earlier fields in `client/src/components/FormBuilder/DataProviderInputConfig.tsx`

- [ ] T057 [US2] Update DynamicDataProviderField to use useDataProviderInputs hook in `client/src/components/FormRenderer/DynamicDataProviderField.tsx`
- [ ] T058 [US2] Implement disabled state with explanatory message in `client/src/components/FormRenderer/DynamicDataProviderField.tsx`
- [ ] T059 [US2] Register blur event handlers on referenced fields in `client/src/components/FormRenderer/FormRenderer.tsx`
- [ ] T060 [US2] Build dependency map from dataProviderInputs in `client/src/components/FormRenderer/FormRenderer.tsx`
- [ ] T061 [US2] Trigger data provider refresh on blur from dependent fields in `client/src/components/FormRenderer/FormRenderer.tsx`

#### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T062 [US2] Create example form with field reference inputs in `seed_data.py`
- [ ] T063 [US2] Manual test: Verify dropdown disabled state when referenced field empty
- [ ] T064 [US2] Manual test: Verify blur event triggers refresh with new field value
- [ ] T065 [US2] Manual test: Verify no refresh during typing (only on blur)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - static inputs work, and field references work with dynamic refresh on blur.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Use JavaScript Expressions for Data Provider Inputs (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable form administrators to use JavaScript expressions to compute input values from form context (e.g., concatenating fields, transformations, accessing workflow properties). Expressions are evaluated safely in a sandboxed context with proper error handling.

**Independent Test**: Create a form with multiple text fields and a dropdown configured with a JavaScript expression input (e.g., `context.field.first_name + ' ' + context.field.last_name`). Enter values in both text fields and verify the dropdown refreshes with the concatenated value. Test error handling by creating an expression that throws an error.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [ ] T075 [US3] Implement expression evaluation in useDataProviderInputs hook in `client/src/hooks/useDataProviderInputs.ts`
- [ ] T076 [US3] Add error handling for expression evaluation (try/catch, timeout) in `client/src/hooks/useDataProviderInputs.ts`
- [ ] T077 [US3] Handle invalid expression results (null, undefined, wrong type) in `client/src/hooks/useDataProviderInputs.ts`
- [ ] T078 [US3] Update DynamicDataProviderField to display expression errors in `client/src/components/FormRenderer/DynamicDataProviderField.tsx`

#### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T081 [US3] Manual test: Verify expression with transformation (e.g., toLowerCase()) works
- [ ] T082 [US3] Manual test: Verify expression accessing context.workflow.* works in workflow context
- [ ] T083 [US3] Manual test: Verify error handling for invalid expressions

**Checkpoint**: All three input modes (static, fieldRef, expression) should now work correctly.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Form Builder UI for Input Configuration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Provide a user-friendly interface in the form builder for configuring data provider inputs without manual JSON editing. The UI displays all available parameters, allows mode selection, and provides appropriate input controls for each mode.

**Independent Test**: Open the form builder, select a data provider for a dropdown field. Verify that a configuration panel appears showing all input parameters with their labels, types, and required status. Test switching between static, field reference, and expression modes for each parameter.

- [ ] T098 [US4] Manual test: Verify required parameter validation prevents save
- [ ] T099 [US4] Manual test: Verify help text and labels display correctly

**Checkpoint**: Form builder UI should be fully functional and user-friendly for all input configuration scenarios.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

### Tests (Write First):
```bash
# Launch all contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test: GET /api/metadata returns data provider parameters"
Task: "Contract test: POST /api/data-providers/{name} accepts inputs object"
Task: "Contract test: POST /api/data-providers/{name} validates required parameters"
Task: "Contract test: POST /api/forms validates dataProviderInputs for required params"

# Launch all integration tests together:
Task: "Integration test: Data provider with @param decorators executes with inputs"
Task: "Integration test: Form save with static dataProviderInputs succeeds"

# Launch unit tests:
Task: "Unit test: Cache key computation includes input hash"
```

### Models (After Tests):
```bash
# All model extensions can run in parallel (different sections of same file):
Task: "Create DataProviderInputMode enum in shared/models.py"
Task: "Create DataProviderInputConfig Pydantic model in shared/models.py"
Task: "Extend FormField model with dataProviderInputs field"
Task: "Extend DataProviderMetadata model with parameters field"
Task: "Extend DataProviderRequest model with inputs field"
```

### Frontend Types & Components:
```bash
# After backend changes:
Task: "Update TypeScript types (run npm run generate:types)"

# Then components in parallel:
Task: "Update dataProviderService to accept inputs parameter"
Task: "Create basic DataProviderInputConfig component"
Task: "Update form renderer to pass static inputs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Goal**: Ship basic static input functionality as fast as possible

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (Review existing code - 4 tasks)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Core models and infrastructure - 12 tasks)
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Static inputs - 29 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Run all US1 tests
   - Test data provider with static inputs via API
   - Test form with static inputs in UI
   - Deploy to staging
5. If successful, demo to stakeholders and collect feedback

**MVP Deliverable**: Data providers can define parameters, forms can configure static values, system validates and executes correctly. **Estimated Tasks: 45**

### Incremental Delivery

**After MVP (US1)**, add features in priority order:

1. **Phase 4: User Story 2** (Field references + dynamic refresh - 20 tasks)
   - Test independently: Token field ‚Üí Repos dropdown
   - Deploy and demo cascading dropdowns

2. **Phase 6: User Story 4** (Form builder UI - 16 tasks)
   - Test independently: Configure inputs without JSON editing
   - Deploy and demo improved UX

3. **Phase 5: User Story 3** (JavaScript expressions - 18 tasks)
   - Test independently: Expression concatenation
   - Deploy and demo advanced use cases

4. **Phase 7: Circular Detection** (12 tasks)
   - Test independently: Invalid circular forms rejected
   - Deploy and demo validation

5. **Phase 8: Polish** (22 tasks)
   - Final cleanup, optimization, documentation
   - Full system validation

**Each increment adds value without breaking previous features**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2: ~16 tasks)

2. **Once Foundational is done, parallelize user stories**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Backend focus - Phase 3)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (Frontend focus - Phase 6)
   - **Developer C**: Circular Detection (Shared - Phase 7)

3. **After US1 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (Phase 4)
   - **Developer B**: Continue US4 or start US3 (Phase 5)
   - **Developer C**: Continue circular detection

4. **Stories integrate and validate independently**

## Task Count Summary

| Phase | Description | Task Count |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | Setup | 4 |
| Phase 2 | Foundational | 12 |
| Phase 3 | User Story 1 (P1) - Static Inputs | 29 |
| Phase 4 | User Story 2 (P2) - Field References | 20 |
| Phase 5 | User Story 3 (P3) - Expressions | 18 |
| Phase 6 | User Story 4 (P2) - Form Builder UI | 16 |
| Phase 7 | Circular Dependency Detection | 15 |
| Phase 8 | Polish & Cross-Cutting | 22 |
| **TOTAL** | | **136 tasks** |

### Tasks Per User Story

- **US1 (MVP)**: 29 implementation + 7 tests = 36 tasks total
- **US2**: 16 implementation + 4 tests = 20 tasks total
- **US3**: 14 implementation + 4 tests = 18 tasks total
- **US4**: 12 implementation + 4 tests = 16 tasks total
- **Shared (Circular Detection)**: 11 implementation + 4 tests = 15 tasks total
- **Foundational**: 12 tasks (blocking for all stories)
- **Setup**: 4 tasks
- **Polish**: 22 tasks

### MVP Scope

**Recommended MVP**: Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 = **45 tasks**

This delivers:
- ‚úÖ Data providers with @param decorators
- ‚úÖ Static input configuration in forms
- ‚úÖ Form validation for required parameters
- ‚úÖ Backend API with input support
- ‚úÖ Basic frontend UI for static inputs
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage

**MVP can be shipped and provide immediate value, then enhanced incrementally.**

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or independent sections, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, Shared, Polish)
- **Test-first approach**: All contract/integration tests written before implementation per Constitution Principle IV
- **Independent stories**: Each user story should be completable and testable independently
- **Checkpoints**: After each user story phase, stop and validate that story works independently
- **File paths**: Backend paths are absolute, frontend paths are in separate client repo
- **Type generation**: Frontend types auto-generated from backend via `npm run generate:types` (requires backend running)
- **Test execution**: Use `./test.sh` for backend tests (starts Azurite), standard `npm test` for frontend

### Avoid
- Vague tasks (each task must be specific and actionable)
- Same file conflicts (coordinate edits or make sequential)
- Cross-story dependencies that break independence (minimize coupling)
- Skipping tests (test-first is non-negotiable per constitution)
