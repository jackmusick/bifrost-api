# Tasks: Azure Key Vault Integration for Secret Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-use-azure-key/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Workflows backend: `workflows/engine/shared/`
- Client API backend: `client/api/`
- Tests: `workflows/tests/` and `client/api/tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [X] T013 Add error handling for ResourceNotFoundError, ClientAuthenticationError, HttpResponseError in workflows/engine/shared/keyvault.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Unified Configuration Access (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Provide a single `get_config()` method that transparently resolves values from plain config or Key Vault based on config type

**Independent Test**: Configure a secret reference (e.g., `api_key` marked as secret type), request that config value in a workflow, and verify the actual secret value is returned from Key Vault

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T014 [US1] Create ConfigResolver class with get_config() method in workflows/engine/shared/config_resolver.py
- [X] T015 [US1] Implement config type detection logic (secret_ref vs plain text) in workflows/engine/shared/config_resolver.py

- [X] T032 [US4] Add clear error messages for permission issues (403 Forbidden) in workflows/engine/shared/keyvault.py
- [X] T033 [US4] Verify no credentials stored in app configuration files

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1, US3, US4 (P1): Can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
  - US2, US5 (P2): Can proceed in parallel after Phase 2 (recommended after US1 for better context)
  - US6 (P3): Can proceed after Phase 2 (recommended after US5 for better context)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 with local fallback
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 with production auth
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds UI for secret selection
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Full secret CRUD in UI
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Health monitoring endpoint

**Recommended Order**: US1 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 (core functionality) ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US5 (UI enhancements) ‚Üí US6 (monitoring)

### Within Each User Story

- API models before endpoints (client/api)
- Backend logic before frontend components
- API client methods before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All dependency installation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T008, T011, T012 marked [P] can run in parallel after T007
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: No parallel opportunities (sequential logic building)
- **Phase 4 (US3)**: No parallel opportunities (extends US1 sequentially)
- **Phase 5 (US4)**: No parallel opportunities (extends US1 sequentially)
- **Phase 6 (US2)**: Tasks T034, T035 can run in parallel; later UI tasks independent
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: Tasks T043, T044, T045 (models) can run in parallel; T053, T054, T055, T056 (UI components) can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 (US6)**: Tasks T064, T065 can run in parallel
- **Phase 9**: All documentation and review tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 5 (Secret Lifecycle Management)

```bash
# Launch all Pydantic models together:
Task: "Create SecretCreateRequest Pydantic model in client/api/shared/models.py"
Task: "Create SecretUpdateRequest Pydantic model in client/api/shared/models.py"
Task: "Create SecretResponse Pydantic model in client/api/shared/models.py"

# After API endpoints are complete, launch all UI components together:
Task: "Create SecretCreate component in client/src/components/secrets/SecretCreate.tsx"
Task: "Create SecretUpdate component in client/src/components/secrets/SecretUpdate.tsx"
Task: "Create SecretDelete component in client/src/components/secrets/SecretDelete.tsx"
Task: "Create SecretList component in client/src/components/secrets/SecretList.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 3, 4 Only - Core P1 Functionality)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (install dependencies)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Key Vault client and infrastructure)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (unified get_config interface)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 3 (local development support)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 4 (production managed identity auth)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test secret resolution end-to-end in both local and production
7. Deploy/demo if ready - **core secret management working!**

### Incremental Delivery (Add UI Enhancements)

1. Complete MVP above (US1, US3, US4)
2. Add Phase 6: User Story 2 ‚Üí Test secret dropdown ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. Add Phase 7: User Story 5 ‚Üí Test full secret CRUD ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add Phase 8: User Story 6 ‚Üí Test health monitoring ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (core get_config)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (local fallback - requires coordination with Dev A)
   - After US1 complete:
     - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (UI dropdown)
     - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (production auth)
     - **Developer C**: User Story 5 (secret CRUD UI)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Security critical**: Ensure no secret values in logs, errors, or UI after initial display
- **Naming convention**: Follow `{org_id}--{secret-name}` or `GLOBAL--{secret-name}` consistently
- **Performance target**: Secret resolution <100ms with caching
- Tests are optional and not included in this task list per feature specification
