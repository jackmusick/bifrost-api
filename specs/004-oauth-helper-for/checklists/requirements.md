## Notes

### Items Requiring Attention

None - all clarifications have been resolved.

### Clarifications Resolved

1. **FR-010 & FR-011** - Token refresh timing: Scheduled job runs every 30 minutes and refreshes tokens expiring within the next 4 hours
2. **FR-017** - Connection deletion behavior: Warn and cascade disable - system warns about dependent workflows and automatically disables them when OAuth connection is deleted

### Validation Results

**Passed Items**: 14/14 checklist items
**Status**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)

The specification successfully avoids implementation details, maintains user focus, and provides comprehensive testable requirements. All mandatory sections are complete with clear success criteria and well-defined user scenarios.
