# Specification Quality Checklist: Dockerized Deployment & Development Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

âœ… **All validation checks passed**

The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Strengths

1. **Clear user journeys**: Five prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
2. **Comprehensive edge cases**: Seven edge cases identified covering failure scenarios
3. **Measurable success criteria**: Ten specific, quantifiable outcomes defined
4. **Technology-agnostic**: All requirements focus on user needs and system behavior without prescribing implementation
5. **Well-scoped**: Clear boundaries defined with "Out of Scope" section
6. **Thorough assumptions**: Eight assumptions documented covering environment, quotas, and capabilities

### Ready for Next Phase

No clarifications or spec updates needed. Proceed with:
- `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- Or `/speckit.clarify` if additional stakeholder input is desired (though not required)
