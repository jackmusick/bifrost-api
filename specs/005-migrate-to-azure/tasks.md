# Tasks: Azure Functions Docker Runtime Migration (Unified Architecture)

**Feature Branch**: `005-migrate-to-azure`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-migrate-to-azure/`
**Architecture**: Single unified Function App (API + workflow engine merged)
**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Exact file paths included in descriptions

**Total Tasks**: 96
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 + User Story 2 (T001-T038)
**Full Scope**: All 4 User Stories

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Merge workflows into api project and initialize unified Function App structure

- [X] T001 Copy engine directory from `/workflows/engine/` to `/api/engine/` preserving all modules (shared/, data_providers/, admin/, execute/)
- [X] T002 Copy workspace directory from `/workflows/workspace/` to `/api/workspace/` with example workflows
- [X] T003 [P] Copy test suites from `/workflows/tests/` to `/api/tests/engine/` to maintain workflow engine test coverage
- [X] T004 [P] Merge `/workflows/requirements.txt` into `/api/requirements.txt` (add azure-storage-file-share>=12.14.1, debugpy>=1.8.0, gitpython for sync)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST complete before ANY user story

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Update `/api/function_app.py` to import and initialize workspace discovery from workflows pattern (discover_workspace_modules function)
- [X] T006 [P] Add import restrictor initialization to `/api/function_app.py` (install_import_restrictions from engine.shared.import_restrictor)
- [X] T007 [P] Add table initialization to `/api/function_app.py` (init_tables from engine.shared.init_tables)
- [X] T008 [P] Import engine data providers in `/api/function_app.py` (import engine.data_providers for built-in providers)
- [X] T009 Deprecated proxy endpoints in `/api/functions/workflows.py` with documentation (direct engine endpoints already registered in function_app.py, proxy kept for backwards compatibility)
- [X] T010 [P] Removed WORKFLOWS_ENGINE_URL and WORKFLOWS_ENGINE_FUNCTION_KEY from `/api/local.settings.example.json` (replaced with WORKSPACE_PATH, TMP_PATH, ENABLE_DEBUGGING for unified architecture)
- [X] T011 [P] Created workspace service layer in `/api/services/workspace_service.py` (list_files, read_file, write_file, delete_file using standard filesystem for mounted directories) + temp file service in `/api/services/temp_file_service.py` (PowerShell-style helpers)
- [X] T012 [P] Created ZIP generation utility in `/api/services/zip_service.py` (create_workspace_zip with in-memory BytesIO buffer per research.md Decision 8, uses workspace_service)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - unified Function App structure complete, user stories can begin

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Local Dev) and US2 (Production Deployment): Can proceed in parallel (both P1 priority)
  - US3 (GitHub Sync) and US4 (Manual Editing): Can proceed in parallel after US1/US2 (both P2 priority)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (T005-T012) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (T005-T012) - Can run in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (T005-T012) and azure_files_service (T011) - Independent from US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (T005-T012), azure_files_service (T011), and zip_service (T012) - Independent from US1/US2/US3

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Dockerfile setup ‚Üí docker-compose configuration ‚Üí debugging setup ‚Üí testing
- **US2**: ARM template resources ‚Üí modules ‚Üí outputs ‚Üí deployment script ‚Üí testing
- **US3**: Models ‚Üí sync service ‚Üí connection CRUD ‚Üí webhook receiver ‚Üí sync processor ‚Üí monitoring endpoints ‚Üí testing
- **US4**: Service layer ‚Üí file CRUD endpoints ‚Üí download ZIP ‚Üí status endpoint ‚Üí testing

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup: T001 (engine copy), T002 (workspace copy), T003 (tests copy), T004 (requirements merge) can all run in parallel
- Foundational: T006 (import restrictor), T007 (tables), T008 (data providers), T010 (remove old config), T011 (azure files service), T012 (ZIP service) can run in parallel after T005
- US1: T013-T016 (Dockerfile setup), T021 (dockerignore), T022 (VS Code config) can run in parallel; T017-T020 (docker-compose) sequential
- US2: T024-T030 (all ARM modules) can run in parallel; T032-T034 (parameters, script, docs) can run in parallel
- US3: T039-T040 (models), T046-T050 (connection endpoints), T060-T061 (sync job endpoints) can run in parallel within their groups
- US4: T074-T080 (all file/directory endpoints) can run in parallel; T081-T083 (download and status) can run in parallel
- Polish: All tasks T094-T108 can run in parallel except T107 (integration test) which depends on all features

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After T005 completes (function_app.py updated), launch in parallel:
Task T006: "Add import restrictor to /api/function_app.py"
Task T007: "Add table initialization to /api/function_app.py"
Task T008: "Import engine data providers in /api/function_app.py"
Task T010: "Remove old workflow engine config from /api/shared/config.py"
Task T011: "Create azure_files_service.py"
Task T012: "Create zip_service.py"

# These touch different files/functions and can proceed simultaneously
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 + User Story 2

```bash
# After Foundational completes, launch both P1 stories in parallel:

# Team Member A works on US1 (Local Development):
Task T013-T016: "Dockerfile setup in /api"
Task T017-T020: "docker-compose.dev.yml configuration"
Task T021-T022: "dockerignore and VS Code config"

# Team Member B works on US2 (Production Deployment):
Task T023: "Create main.bicep"
Task T024-T030: "Create all ARM modules in parallel"
Task T031-T034: "Outputs, parameters, script, docs"

# Both stories progress independently with no conflicts
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 - P1 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004) - Merge projects
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T012) - CRITICAL blocking phase (unified Function App)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T022) - Local development with Docker
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T023-T038) - Production deployment with ARM template
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test local docker-compose, deploy to Azure, trigger workflow via UI
6. Deploy/demo MVP (local dev + production deployment with unified architecture)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Unified Function App foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test local docker-compose ‚Üí Demo (working local development!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test ARM deployment ‚Üí Demo (working production with single Function App!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test GitHub sync ‚Üí Demo (automated workspace updates!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test manual editing ‚Üí Demo (complete platform with dual edit modes!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T012)
2. Once Foundational done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Local Development)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Production Deployment)
   - Progress in parallel since they touch different concerns
3. After US1/US2 complete (MVP delivered):
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (GitHub Sync)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Manual Editing)
   - Progress in parallel since they are independent features
4. All developers: Polish phase together (T094-T108)

## Success Metrics

After completing all tasks, verify these success criteria from spec.md:

- **SC-001**: Local dev starts in <5 minutes ‚úì (US1)
- **SC-002**: Production deployment in <30 minutes ‚úì (US2)
- **SC-003**: GitHub sync in <2 minutes ‚úì (US3)
- **SC-004**: Manual edits available in <5 seconds ‚úì (US4)
- **SC-004a**: ZIP download in <10 seconds ‚úì (US4)
- **SC-005**: Debugger attachment works ‚úì (US1)
- **SC-006**: ARM template 95% first-time success ‚úì (US2)
- **SC-007**: 100 executions/hour ‚úì (US2)
- **SC-008**: 99.9% workspace uptime ‚úì (US2)
- **SC-009**: Editor ops <2 seconds ‚úì (US4)
- **SC-010**: Zero manual config steps ‚úì (US2 - unified architecture eliminates workflow URL/function key)
- **SC-011**: Workflow execution latency <100ms ‚úì (US2 - direct invocation, no HTTP overhead)

---

## Key Architectural Changes from Original Plan

**Unified Function App Benefits** (FR-001a):
- Single container image combining API and workflow engine
- Direct function invocation (no HTTP proxy between API and workflows)
- No workflow engine URL or function key configuration needed (SC-010, SC-011)
- Simpler deployment (1 Function App instead of 2)
- Reduced operational complexity (50% fewer services)
- Lower execution latency (<100ms vs ~200-500ms with HTTP proxy)

**Migration Note**: Existing deployments with separate API and workflow Function Apps are not automatically migrated (out of scope per spec). See `/docs/migration-from-separate-function-apps.md` after T108 completion.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies ‚Üí can run in parallel
- [Story] label (US1, US2, US3, US4) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Foundational phase (T005-T012) is CRITICAL and blocks all user stories - prioritize completion
- Unified Function App architecture eliminates cross-service dependencies and configuration complexity
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Stories 1 and 2 are P1 (MVP) - deliver these first for maximum value
- User Stories 3 and 4 are P2 (enhancements) - can be delivered incrementally after MVP
- Total estimated effort: 4-5 weeks for experienced developer (MVP: 2 weeks, full: 4-5 weeks)
