# Tasks: Integration Mapping Framework

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-integration-mapping-framework/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL in this feature - Constitution requires test-first, so tests ARE included for all non-trivial business logic.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
This is a **web application** split across 3 repositories:
- **api/**: Management API (Python 3.11 Azure Functions)
- **workflows/**: Workflow engine (Python 3.11 Azure Functions)
- **client/**: React frontend (TypeScript)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories 1-3 (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion - these are P1 (MVP scope)
  - US1 (Enable Integration): Foundation for US2 and US3
  - US2 (Map Organization): Depends on US1 (needs discovery), foundation for US3
  - US3 (Retrieve in Workflow): Can start after Foundation, logically after US2 (needs mappings to retrieve)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + US3 (uses same context methods)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 (extends UI from US2)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on Foundational + US1 (uses IntegrationInterface.test_connection())
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs discovery endpoint) - Logically sequential after US1
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - May benefit from US2 existing (test data), but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses same APIs as US3, independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Depends on US2 completion (extends same UI) - Logically sequential after US2
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational + US1 (needs IntegrationInterface) - Independently testable

### Recommended Execution Order

**For MVP (P1 only - minimum viable product)**:
1. Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Phase 2: Foundational
2. Phase 3: US1 (Enable Integration) - Test independently
3. Phase 4: US2 (Map Organization) - Test independently
4. Phase 5: US3 (Retrieve in Workflow) - Test independently
5. **STOP**: MVP complete! Can map orgs and use in workflows

**For Full Feature (P1 + P2)**:
6. Phase 6: US4 (Create from Workflow) - Test independently
7. Phase 7: US5 (Manage Mappings UI) - Test independently

**For Complete Feature (P1 + P2 + P3)**:
8. Phase 8: US6 (Test Connection) - Test independently
9. Phase 9: Polish

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Backend models before backend services
- Backend endpoints before frontend services
- Frontend services before frontend components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:

- Then: T043-T048 sequential (UI integration)

**User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:
- Tests: T049 (happy path) || T050 (error 1) || T051 (error 2)
- Implementation: T052 (exception 1) || T053 (exception 2)
- Then: T054-T058 sequential (context methods)

**User Story 4 (Phase 6)**:
- Tests: T059 (create) || T060 (update)
- Then: T061-T064 sequential (context method)

**User Story 5 (Phase 7)**:
- Tests: T065 (contract) || T066 (update test) || T067 (delete test)
- Backend: T068 (model) || T069 (get endpoint) || T070 (update endpoint) || T071 (delete endpoint)
- Then: T072-T075 sequential (backend logic)
- Frontend: T076 (edit dialog) || T077 (delete dialog)
- Then: T078-T083 sequential (UI integration)

**User Story 6 (Phase 8)**:
- Tests: T084 (API test) || T085 (interface test)
- Backend: T086 (endpoint scaffold)
- Then: T087-T090 sequential (test logic)
- Frontend: T091 (dialog) || T092 (service)
- Then: T093-T096 sequential (UI integration)

**Polish Phase (Phase 9)**:
- T097-T102 (all improvements) || T107 (example integration)
- Then: T103-T108 sequential (optimizations, validation)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only - P1 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Tables + Storage scaffold)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Enable Integration & Discovery)
4. **CHECKPOINT**: Test discovery endpoint independently - can list external orgs
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Map Organization via UI)
6. **CHECKPOINT**: Test mapping creation independently - can create and view mappings
7. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Retrieve in Workflow)
8. **CHECKPOINT**: Test workflow retrieval independently - workflows can access mapped orgs
9. **STOP and VALIDATE**: All 3 P1 stories work together - MVP is ready!
10. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Validation Checklist**:
- ‚úÖ Can discover external organizations from integration
- ‚úÖ Can create mapping via UI
- ‚úÖ Mapping persisted in both tables
- ‚úÖ Workflow can retrieve mapping and use external org ID
- ‚úÖ All acceptance scenarios from spec.md US1-3 pass

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Tables and core models ready
2. **MVP (P1)**: Add US1-3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Delivers: Integration discovery, mapping creation, workflow usage
   - Value: Zero-code integration setup for any integration
3. **Enhanced (P1+P2)**: Add US4-5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Adds: Workflow automation, mapping management UI
   - Value: Automated provisioning, better UX
4. **Complete (P1+P2+P3)**: Add US6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Adds: Connection testing
   - Value: Troubleshooting and validation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (1-2 days)
2. **Once Foundational is done** (can parallelize user stories):
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Discovery) + User Story 6 (Test Connection)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Map UI) + User Story 5 (Manage UI)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Workflow Retrieval) + User Story 4 (Workflow Creation)
3. **Stories complete and integrate independently**

**Note**: US1 should complete before US2 starts (US2 depends on discovery), but US3-4 can be done in parallel with US1-2.

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story is independently completable and testable** (validates acceptance criteria from spec.md)
- **Tests written first** (TDD): Verify tests fail before implementing
- **Commit after each task** or logical group
- **Stop at any checkpoint** to validate story independently
- **MVP = User Stories 1-3** (P1 priority): Provides core value with minimal scope
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 108 tasks
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 3 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 12 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - P1)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - P1)**: 21 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - P1)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - P2)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - P2)**: 19 tasks
- **Phase 8 (US6 - P3)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: 12 tasks

**MVP Scope** (P1 only): 15 + 47 tasks = 62 tasks to complete US1-3
**Parallel Opportunities**: 40+ tasks marked [P] across all phases
