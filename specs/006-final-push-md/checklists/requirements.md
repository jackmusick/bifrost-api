# Specification Quality Checklist: Platform Enhancement Suite - Final Push

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
✅ **Pass** - Specification maintains focus on WHAT users need without prescribing HOW to implement:
- No specific technologies mentioned (frameworks, databases, APIs)
- Requirements describe user-facing capabilities and business outcomes
- Language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **Pass** - All requirements are testable and unambiguous:
- Each functional requirement uses specific verbs (MUST, MUST be able to) with clear acceptance criteria
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (informed guesses made with documented assumptions)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- User scenarios include Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios for each story
- Edge cases identified for boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope clearly defined through 10 prioritized user stories
- Dependencies implicit in existing platform capabilities (forms, workflows, Azure infrastructure)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **Pass** - All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001 through SC-015 include specific metrics (time, percentages, volumes)
- Criteria focus on user-observable outcomes, not implementation details
- Examples: "under 10 minutes", "95% success rate", "under 2 seconds"
- No references to specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- Mix of quantitative (time, performance) and qualitative (task completion) measures

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **Pass** - Feature is ready for planning phase:
- All 81 functional requirements have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- 10 user stories cover all primary flows with prioritization (P1, P2, P3)
- Each user story includes independent test descriptions
- Success criteria align with functional requirements
- No implementation details present in specification
- Feature scope is comprehensive but well-bounded through prioritization

## Assumptions Documented

The following reasonable assumptions were made to avoid excessive clarification markers:

1. **File Upload Limits**: 100MB maximum file size (industry standard for web applications)
2. **Authentication Method**: Entra ID (Microsoft Azure AD) based on existing platform context
3. **Storage Backend**: Azure Blob Storage for file uploads (consistent with Azure Functions architecture)
4. **Performance Targets**: Standard web application expectations (2-3 second page loads, sub-second search)
5. **Scope Handling**: Organizational scope switching uses existing platform mechanism
6. **Key Encryption**: Workflow API keys stored encrypted at rest (security best practice)
7. **CRON Implementation**: Standard CRON expression syntax with Azure Functions timer triggers
8. **Async Queue**: Azure Storage Queues or Service Bus for workflow queueing
9. **Session Persistence**: Status refresh uses polling (WebSocket alternative considered out of scope)
10. **Branding Storage**: Logo files stored in Azure Blob Storage with CDN delivery

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. No further clarifications needed - all requirements are testable and well-defined.
