## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-12)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order
  - Suggested MVP: Phase 3 (User Story 1) only
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Enhanced Forms**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Rich Components**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1, but integrates with form context
- **User Story 3 (P1) - Workflow HTTP API**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Async Execution**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 5 (P2) - CRON Scheduling**: Can start after Foundational - May integrate with US4 (async execution)
- **User Story 6 (P2) - Enhanced Search**: Can start after Foundational - Can be added to any completed user story's UI
- **User Story 7 (P3) - Platform Branding**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 8 (P3) - Execution Logs**: Can start after Foundational - Benefits from US4 (async logs) but independent
- **User Story 9 (P3) - System Workspace**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 10 (P2) - Enhanced Auth**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (for stories with tests)
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Component implementations within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Parallel Example: Setup Phase
```bash
# Launch all setup tasks together:
Task: "Install backend dependencies"
Task: "Install frontend dependencies"
Task: "Setup local development environment"
Task: "Initialize type generation scripts"
```

### Parallel Example: Foundational Phase
```bash
# Launch all foundational tasks together:
Task: "Extend Table Storage models"
Task: "Configure authentication utilities"
Task: "Setup Blob Storage integration"
Task: "Extend Users table model"
```

### Parallel Example: User Story 1
```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for enhanced form context"
Task: "Integration test for form context system"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Update form models"
Task: "Implement form context provider"
```

### Parallel Example: User Story 2
```bash
# Launch all component implementations together:
Task: "Create MarkdownComponent"
Task: "Create HTMLComponent"
Task: "Create DateTimeComponent"
Task: "Create RadioComponent"
Task: "Create FileUploadComponent"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2 Only)

This delivers core form enhancement capabilities:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Enhanced Form Builder with Context)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Rich Form Components)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Value**: Dynamic forms with context, visibility conditions, rich components, and file uploads. Forms can execute workflows on launch and respond to user input in real-time.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (HTTP API) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Async) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (CRON) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 (Search) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Add User Story 7 (Branding) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
9. Add User Story 8 (Logs) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
10. Add User Story 9 (System Workspace) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
11. Add User Story 10 (Enhanced Auth) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
12. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Enhanced Forms)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Rich Components)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Workflow HTTP API)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Async Execution)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Continue with remaining stories based on priority

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 116 tasks across all phases
- **Setup Phase**: 3 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 5 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **User Story 1**: 7 tasks (2 tests + 5 implementation)
- **User Story 2**: 10 tasks (2 tests + 8 implementation)
- **User Story 3**: 8 tasks (2 tests + 6 implementation)
- **User Story 4**: 7 tasks (2 tests + 5 implementation)
- **User Story 5**: 6 tasks (2 tests + 4 implementation)
- **User Story 6**: 6 tasks (all implementation, no tests - UI feature)
- **User Story 7**: 4 tasks (1 test + 3 implementation)
- **User Story 8**: 4 tasks (all implementation)
- **User Story 9**: 5 tasks (all implementation)
- **User Story 10**: 5 tasks (2 tests + 3 implementation)
- **Polish Phase**: 7 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 60+ tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2) = 25 tasks
**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear acceptance criteria from spec.md
