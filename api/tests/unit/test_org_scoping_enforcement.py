"""Mechanical enforcement of the org-scoping pattern.

Three tests:

1. ``test_no_inline_org_scoping_in_routers`` — no raw ``organization_id ==``
   or ``organization_id.is_(None)`` outside the canonical
   ``OrgScopedRepository`` base class. Allow-listed lines are exempt with a
   one-line justification.

2. ``test_org_scoped_models_have_repository`` — every ORM model with an
   ``organization_id`` column either has an ``OrgScopedRepository``
   subclass or is on the explicit identity-entity allow-list.

3. ``test_sdk_endpoints_use_resolver`` — every SDK endpoint that accepts a
   ``scope`` parameter calls ``resolve_effective_scope``. Allow-listed
   endpoints document why they're exempt.

These tests are the load-bearing mechanism that prevents the pattern from
drifting. Allow-lists shrink as code migrates. When you add an entry,
include a comment explaining why — code review enforces accountability.

See ``api/src/repositories/README.md`` for the full pattern.
