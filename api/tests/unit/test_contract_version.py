"""CLI compatibility contract tripwire.

Two jobs:

1. **Legacy bridge sync** — the CLI and server copies of the frozen version-10
   transition marker must agree while ``GET /api/version`` exposes it for CLIs
   released before minimum-version gating was restored.

2. **Tripwire** — a fingerprint over the contract surface the CLI actually
   depends on (the request/response DTOs it sends + the routes it calls). Any
   change to that surface flips the fingerprint, failing this test until the
   author makes an explicit decision: raise ``MIN_CLI_VERSION`` to the release
   containing a CLI-impacting/breaking change, or just refresh the fingerprint
   for a compatible additive/cosmetic change. This makes a missed compatibility
   decision a red test instead of a production incident.

The fingerprint is computed live, in-process, and only ever compared to a
constant committed in THIS file — never shipped or compared across machines —
so cross-machine schema-serialization differences are irrelevant.

#: above already catch. We keep only `/api/version` itself, since the gate's own
#: handshake depends on that literal path.

EXPECTED_CONTRACT_FINGERPRINT = (
    # ApplicationCreate.app_model default flipped inline_v1 → standalone_v2
    # (2026-06-13). CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 3: an old CLI would default a new
    # `apps create` to v1 against a v2-default server, so old clients are gated.
    #
    # SDKIntegrationsGetRequest gained optional `solution` (2026-06-14,
    # RequiredConnectionUnset escalation). ADDITIVE — an old CLI simply omits the
    # field and keeps silent-None behavior, so no CONTRACT_VERSION bump; fingerprint
    # refreshed only.
    #
    # Solution deploy now returns 202 + deploy_job_id and the CLI polls
    # SolutionDeployJobStatus for the prior summary shape (2026-06-17).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 5.
    #
    # Solution deploy now uploads a workspace zip as multipart/form-data instead
    # of the legacy JSON bundle request body (2026-06-21).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 6.
    #
    # TablePolicies policies union widened to list[Policy | PolicyRuleRef] (2026-06-23).
    # ADDITIVE: old CLIs send plain inline rules; PolicyRuleRef is a new optional
    # variant — no old client is broken. Fingerprint refreshed only.
    #
    # PolicyRuleCreate + PolicyRuleUpdate added to CLI contract surface (2026-06-23).
    # ADDITIVE: new entity group (policy-rule), no existing DTOs changed.
    # Fingerprint refreshed only.
    #
    # Solution install (zip + from-repo) is now async: POST /install and
    # /install/from-repo return 202 + deploy_job_id (was 200/201 + Solution) and
    # the CLI/UI poll SolutionDeployJobStatus for the solution_id. That job status'
    # install_id widened to nullable (a zip install resolves its target inside the
    # job) — a response-shape change the CLI parses (2026-07-02).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 7.
    #
    # Application publish now returns 202 + a standardized platform job instead
    # of ApplicationPublic, and the CLI polls PlatformJobPublic for durable
    # progress/result/error (2026-07-28). CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 8.
    #
    # Forms gained optional confirmation_markdown (2026-08-04). ADDITIVE: old
    # clients omit it and continue receiving the prior default confirmation.
    #
    # RoleCreate/RoleUpdate gained additive scopes fields (2026-07-30).
    # Old CLIs omit them and retain empty-scope custom-role behavior.
    # Forms also gained optional confirmation_markdown (2026-08-04). All are
    # additive; fingerprint refreshed after merging the contract surfaces.
    #
    # CLI/SDK file write and delete requests gained optional guarded-mutation
    # fields (2026-08-08). ADDITIVE: old clients omit them and retain the prior
    # unconditional behavior; new clients can reject stale writes and deletes.
    #
    # PlatformJobStatus gained `waiting` for durable parent jobs (2026-08-07).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 9 because an older CLI cannot parse the new
    # enum value while polling PlatformJobPublic.
    #
    # The server-controlled minimum CLI gate was restored (2026-08-14).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 10 as a one-time bridge because CLIs released
    # while min_cli_version was absent cannot honor that floor themselves.
    #
    # LLM configuration provider enums gained `google` (2026-08-14). ADDITIVE:
    # old clients can keep selecting OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic providers.
    #
    # SDK AI completion requests gained optional file inputs (2026-08-15).
    # ADDITIVE: old SDK clients omit the field and keep text-only behavior.
    #
    # PlatformJobPublic gained optional memory_required_bytes (2026-08-23).
    # ADDITIVE: old clients ignore the scheduler admission detail.
    #
    # Agent create/update replaced the raw llm_model field with llm_profile_id
    # (2026-08-22). BREAKING: older CLIs cannot express reusable model profiles,
    # and SDK AI model info no longer reports the removed profile max_tokens
    # value. Both ship behind the same unreleased 1.2.3 minimum CLI boundary.
    #
    # SDK AI completion requests gained optional `profile` (2026-08-23).
    # ADDITIVE: older SDKs omit it and continue using the Primary assignment.
    #
    # EventSubscriptionCreate's filter_expression description now documents
    # its enforced JMESPath-compatible behavior (2026-08-26). COSMETIC: the
    # field shape is unchanged; fingerprint refreshed only.
    #
    # WorkflowParameter gained optional python_type and json_schema fields
    # (2026-09-04). ADDITIVE: older clients ignore the richer tool-contract
    # metadata, so the fingerprint is refreshed without raising MIN_CLI_VERSION.
    #
    # IntegrationCreate/IntegrationUpdate gained optional description
    # (2026-09-09). ADDITIVE: older clients omit it and keep existing behavior.
