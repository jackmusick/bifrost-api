"""Round-trip E2E: export a deployed solution (app + workflow) then install the
zip into a DIFFERENT org and confirm both entities land in the target org.

Task 4 of the Solutions success-criteria programme.

Design notes:
- Uses the same sync ``e2e_client`` + ``platform_admin`` pattern as sibling
  tests (no async httpx needed — the stack exposes blocking httpx at
  ``tests/e2e/conftest.py:e2e_client``).
- The source solution is deployed with a ``standalone_v2`` app carrying a
  pre-built ``dist_files`` payload (bypasses the Vite build so the test stack
  doesn't need npm) and a Python workflow file.
- Export produces a live-rebuilt zip (Task 1/2 rebuild path — no stale cache).
- Install targets a fresh org created inline; the slug is unique per run so a
  fresh install is always created for the target org.
- Assertions check GET /api/solutions/{id}/entities for at least one app and
  one workflow — not just that install returned 200.
