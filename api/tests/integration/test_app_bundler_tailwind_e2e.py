"""End-to-end-ish test of the Tailwind bundling step.

Exercises the real @tailwindcss/node compiler subprocess. Materializes a
fake app source tree, runs ONLY the tailwind generation step, and asserts
the produced CSS contains rules for arbitrary values that were previously
silently broken in v2 apps.

This is the "does the experiment actually work?" guard rail. If
@tailwindcss/node is missing from the API container, or the candidate
extractor regresses, this test fails loudly.

Run via: `./test.sh tests/integration/test_app_bundler_tailwind_e2e.py -v`
