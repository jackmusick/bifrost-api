"""Build the installable ``bifrost`` web SDK package served by /api/sdk/download.

A ``standalone_v2`` Solution app imports ``"bifrost"`` while the CLI installs it
transiently from the selected instance (``npm install`` against /api/sdk/download), so the
SAME mechanism works on a developer laptop (``npm run dev``) and in the platform's
server-side build. This module produces the npm-installable tarball on the fly,
version-stamped to the running instance — directly analogous to the CLI's
``/api/cli/download/bifrost-cli.tar.gz`` (a Python tarball).

The SDK source (provider, tables, hooks) lives in ``client/src/lib/app-sdk`` and
is copied into the api image at ``sdk_src/`` (see Dockerfile). It is bundled with
esbuild into one ESM file with ``react``/``react-dom`` kept EXTERNAL (peer deps —
the consuming app provides them so React stays a singleton).
