"""
Solution deploy — full-replace reconcile scoped strictly to ``solution_id``.

Deploy is the single writer for a disconnected install (success-criteria §3.6):
it upserts everything in the bundle and deletes entities previously under THIS
``solution_id`` that are absent from the new bundle. The deletion sweep is
gated on ``WHERE solution_id == sid AND id NOT IN bundle_ids`` — so it can never
touch ``_repo/`` rows (``solution_id IS NULL``) or any other install (a
different ``solution_id``). Scope correctness is by construction, not by a
path-existence heuristic (the destructive global sweep that the viability study
flagged is deliberately NOT reused here).

Python (workflows, modules) installs **as source** to ``_solutions/{id}/`` via
SolutionStorage and is executed as source by the virtual importer (§3.6). Every
deployed entity inherits the install's scope — its ``organization_id`` is the
install's ``organization_id`` (org-scoped or NULL/global), with no per-entity
scope binding (criterion 8).

Sub-plan 1 wires workflows end-to-end (the load-bearing path proven by the
execution criteria). Apps/forms/agents/tables hang off the same reconcile shape
and are added in their sub-plans.

        same map. The caller's ``bundle`` is NEVER mutated.

        Returning a fresh bundle (rather than mutating in place) makes deploy
        idempotent for the caller's object: deploying the SAME SolutionBundle
        instance twice in one process must not double-remap (the 2nd pass would

        them AGAIN, scrambling the wiring and making reconcile delete the rows it
        just created — Codex #8 P2). Entity dicts are deep-copied so the input's
        nested structures are untouched too.

        Two-pass so a cross-ref can point at any entity regardless of order:
          1. Build ``id_map`` (manifest id → remapped id) across ALL entity
             types, stamping each copy's own ``id``.

             point outside the bundle are left untouched — they resolve by path
             within the install's solution scope at runtime.
