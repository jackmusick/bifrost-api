Authorization Service

Provides permission checking and access control for the Bifrost platform.
This service handles three layers of access control:

1. Organization Scoping (OrgScopedRepository)
   - Tenant isolation via organization_id filtering
   - PlatformAdmins can access any org via X-Organization-Id header

2. Role-Based Access Control
   - Forms can be restricted to specific roles
   - accessLevel: "authenticated" (any logged-in user) or "role_based" (role membership required)

3. User-Level Ownership
   - Executions are filtered by the user who triggered them
   - PlatformAdmins can view all executions in scope
