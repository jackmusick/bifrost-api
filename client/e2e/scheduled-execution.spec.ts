/**
 * Scheduled Executions Happy Paths (Admin)
 *
 * End-to-end coverage for the deferred-executions feature surfaced on the
 * History page:
 *
 * 1. Schedule → Success: a row scheduled with a short delay is listed as
 *    `Scheduled`, the promoter ticks (every 60s), the worker runs it, and the
 *    badge flips to `Completed` (the label the UI uses for Success) after a
 *    manual refresh.
 * 2. Cancel from row menu: a long-delayed scheduled row can be cancelled via
 *    the row's icon button → AlertDialog → confirm, and the badge flips to
 *    `Cancelled` (optimistically, then server-backed).
 *
 * Fixture: registers a trivial workflow via /api/workflows/register. The
 * inline-code path is blocked for scheduled executions server-side (contract
 * rejects `code + scheduled_at`), so we need a real workflow registration.
 *
 * Runs under the `chromium` project (default), which is authenticated as
 * platform_admin.
