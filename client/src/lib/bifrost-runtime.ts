/**
 * Bifrost runtime surface for bundled apps.
 *
 * This module re-exports everything that user code can `import { X } from "bifrost"`.
 * BundledAppShell installs an import map entry pointing `"bifrost"` at a blob module
 * that re-exports all of these — so the bundler treats `"bifrost"` as an external
 * and the browser resolves it to this host-loaded module at runtime.
 *
 * Anything exported here is part of the public `bifrost` package surface.
